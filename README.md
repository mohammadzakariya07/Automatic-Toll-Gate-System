# 🚧 Automatic Toll Gate System using Arduino & IR Sensors

## 📌 Overview
The Automatic Toll Gate System is an Arduino-based automation project designed to detect vehicles using IR sensors and operate a toll gate using a servo motor. The system minimizes human intervention and improves efficiency at toll plazas.

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensor
- Servo Motor
- LCD Display (16x2)
- Buzzer (Optional)
- Power Supply
- Jumper Wires

## ⚙️ Working
1. IR sensor detects an approaching vehicle.
2. Arduino processes the signal.
3. LCD displays system status.
4. Servo motor opens the toll gate.
5. After vehicle passes, gate closes automatically.
